Whether you work with code on GitHub professionally, or you simply want to highlight
your professional life, your GitHub profile is an excellent venue.
Again, think about your in-person introduction, but this time, in a professional setting.
How would you want to introduce yourself professionally? Here are some ideas.
• Current employment info & responsibilities:
e.g. 'I work with Adafruit.'
e.g. 'I work at a Fortune 500 company designing children's toys.'
• Past employment info & responsibilities:
e.g. 'I previously worked in health care.'
e.g. 'I managed an IT solution that optimized three global ERP instances.'
• Professional projects you're involved with:
e.g. 'I work on the CircuitPython project.'
e.g. 'I write automation using Python for IoT-enabled devices.'
• Skills & relevant topics you've cultivated through work:
e.g. 'I am a successful community leader.'
e.g. 'I have experience with microcontrollers.'
e.g. 'I am an experienced developer advocate.'
• Where your professional work has been featured - showcase your skills and
projects together:
e.g. 'You can find my documentation in the Adafruit Learn System and on
GitHub.'
e.g. 'I am a CircuitPython developer, and you can find my contributions in the
Adafruit CircuitPython libraries.'
• Professional goals:
e.g. 'I want to be a senior software architect.'
e.g. 'My goal is to create software & hardware solutions that are accessible
world-wide and can help many people.'
There are definitely ways to expand upon what's laid out here. This should get you
going.
